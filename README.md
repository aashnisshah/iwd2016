# IWD2016
I made this on International Women's Day, 2016.

My initial inspiration was to see if I could create a parallax-styled effect on some header text that would make every other letter split apart into opposite directions. I eventually added quotes, and the quote reset option as well (by scrolling back to the top of the page).

##How to use this:
1. Download the files
2. Open the `index.html` file in a browser
3. Scroll down and watch as the #IWD2016 content separates and fades
4. See a quote at the bottom
5. Scroll back to the top, then back to the bottom to 'reset' the quotes, and see a different one

Feel free to add your own quotes!
